 * @brief NVL144 Power Control class
 *
 * This class represents the NVL144 platform-specific power control.
 * Since VRPowerControl's default implementations already use NVL144 behavior,
 * this class typically does NOT need to override anything unless there are
 * NVL144-specific deviations from the VR defaults.
 *
 * Platform characteristics:
 * - Has NVL144 PDB (Power Distribution Board)
 * - Uses E1S Power Enable
 * - Uses BMC SSD Reset
 * - Supports Board 0 and optionally Board 1
 * - After PDB powers up, asserts E1S and BMC SSD enables before HPM sequencing
